## Introduction

The DOE ARM [Tracking Aerosol Convection Interaction Experiment (TRACER) campaign](https://www.arm.gov/research/campaigns/amf2021tracer) took place in the Houston, TX region from 01 October 2021 through 30 September 2022, with an IOP from June-September 2022, which collected a comprehensive data set focused on the evolution of convective clouds and their environment (including aerosol, cloud, thermodynamics, and lightning). A unique component of TRACER is that a large number of individual, isolated convective cells will be tracked and measured with high spatial and temporal resolution. These comprehensive, unique observational datasets can help evaluate model and parameterization performance, identify model and parameterization deficiencies, and gain new insights to improve models. This provides the motivation for conducting an additional community model intercomparison project (MIP) based on the previous Aerosol Cloud Precipitation Climate (ACPC) Deep Convective Cloud (DCC) MIP (ACPC-MIP; van den Heever et al. 2017; Marinescu et al. 2021; Saleeby et al. 2025; van den Heever et al. 2025), which is referred to as the TRACER-MIP.

## Goals and Hypotheses of the TRACER-MIP

### Goals

1. Quantify the inter-model spread in representation of aerosol-convection interactions (ACI), identify model deficiencies, and measure model performance.
2. Examine factors/processes leading to the model biases and large model spread, both of which were less emphasized in the previous ACPC-MIP. This effort will ultimately help reduce the ACI uncertainty.

### Hypotheses

1. The different representations of condensation and ice microphysics are a major source of  inter-model spread, thus, leading to the main model differences in the simulation of ACI.
2. The models that reproduce the observed cases and employ explicit calculation of condensation give qualitatively consistent ACI effects, particularly for the effect of ultrafine particles.
