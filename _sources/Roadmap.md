# Tracking Aerosol Convection Interaction Experiment (TRACER) Model Intercomparison Project (MIP) Roadmap
## 1. Introduction
The DOE ARM Tracking Aerosol Convection Interaction Experiment (TRACER) campaign (https://www.arm.gov/research/campaigns/amf2021tracer) took place in the Houston, TX region from 01 October 2021 through 30 September 2022, with an IOP from June-September 2022, which collected a comprehensive data set focused on the evolution of convective clouds and their environment (including aerosol, cloud, thermodynamics, and lightning). A unique component of TRACER is that a large number of individual, isolated convective cells will be tracked and measured with high spatial and temporal resolution. These comprehensive, unique observational datasets can help evaluate model and parameterization performance, identify model and parameterization deficiencies, and gain new insights to improve models. This provides the motivation for conducting an additional community model intercomparison project (MIP) based on the previous Aerosol Cloud Precipitation Climate (ACPC) Deep Convective Cloud (DCC) MIP (ACPC-MIP; van den Heever et al. 2017; Marinescu et al. 2021; Saleeby et al. 2025; van den Heever et al. 2025), which is referred to as the TRACER-MIP
